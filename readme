Alright, what the heck is going on here?  Why are all the lights so bright?  My big toe itches!

This is my attempt at following the configuration architecture discussed at http://furius.ca/projects/doc/conf.html.

I know, I know.  There are like 100 different ways to do this and they are all easier than this route.  However, I have the following requirements that might make this scheme the best.

1) Multiple platforms (Ubuntu, OS X, and (shudder) Windows (Cygwin)) using common tools.  There are certain portions of configurations that are common, and others that are specific to different platforms and different hosts.
2) The need to make changes on one platform and optionally have them impact other platforms.
3) Easy and quick syncing.
4) Version control.

At the moment, I have high-level scripts that I symlink to from ~ in to_symlink, based on host.  The rest gets taken care of more or less like the aforementioned article suggests.  I don't really have a need for site-specific files.  I could see transitioning some of the servers that I have to this scheme.  Basically I just want to DRY up my configuration, and this seems like one way to do it.  I could use some sort of rsync scripting system, or even polished configuration management systems, but it seems like my requirements are beyond what these can do.  I could be wrong.

Well, that's my quick description of what's going on here, feel free to comment or email me at panozzaj@gmail.com.  Thanks!
