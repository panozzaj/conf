# `print_wb`

Vim color scheme. White text on a black background. No syntax highlighting.

Sometimes I want to edit code without syntax highlighting on a dark background with maximal contrast. Previously I used the `print_bw` color scheme, which puts black text on a white background. So I took `print_bw.vim` and changed all of the references of white to black, and vice versa.

## Installation

Use the Vim package manager of your choice.
